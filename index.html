          <h4 class="text-center">About This Tool</h4>
          This tool was written to assist Pokemon Sun and Moon Players with "SOS Chaining" who wish to collect Shiny Pokemon, Perfect IV Pokemon, and Pokemon with a Hidden Ability. This tool is made with information adapted from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/5hmd9h/spoiler_some_more_indepth_mechanics_on_sos_battle/">this reddit thread</a> (most written notes are copied and pasted from the thread so the thread gets credit for notes on this app). I've also been asked to credit <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/is-anybody-researching-sun-moon-shiny-chaining.450904/">this GBATemp Thread</a>.

          <h4 class="text-center">Technical Notes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The game uses an 8-bit counter to count chain length, so it only goes up to a maximum of 0xFF (255), after which it rolls over to 0 again. What this means is that it is possible to chain up to 280, for example, and only catch a Pokemon with 3 perfect IVs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h4 class="text-center">Other Notes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Assuming the Masuda method in this game is the same as in Gen VI, using it with a shiny charm yields a shiny chance of 8/4096 (five extra rolls from MM and two extra from charm), or a 1/512 chance per egg. Make of that what you will.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="text-center">Shiny Odds</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Chain length of 0 to 69 - Presumably, one and two extra rolls are added somewhere in between a chain of 1 and 69, but it's not yet known exactly where in the chain this happens.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chain length of 70 to 255 - Three extra rolls for a shiny spawn. After a chain of 70 the game rolls the shiny chance an extra three times, meaning the normal chance of 1/4096 gets increased to 4/4096, effectively giving a chance of 1/1024. With a shiny charm, this chance is originally 3/4096 (two extra rolls for shiny spawn), and so gets boosted to 6/4096 after a chain of 70, effectively giving about a 1/683 chance of a shiny until the chain counter rolls over to 0.
